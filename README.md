## 🎯 Overview

**Guardian Angel** is an innovative mobile application providing **step-by-step, interactive guidance during medical emergencies**.  

- Aims to bridge the gap for the ~90% of people lacking proper first-aid knowledge.  
- Designed for **parents, teachers, travelers, and caregivers**.  
- Offers **hands-free, voice-assisted, offline guidance** with visual aids for high-stress situations.  
- Transforms the smartphone into a reliable **life-saving companion**.

The app originated from a real-life incident where a friend suffered severe burns, highlighting the need for **immediate, clear instructions under stress**.

## ❗ Problem Statement
- **Too much information:** Guides are overwhelming under stress  
- **Panic & confusion:** Users may freeze or act incorrectly  
- **Hard to use phones:** Emergencies limit reading/holding devices  
- **No internet:** Many incidents occur offline  

**Target users:** Parents, teachers, hikers, cooks, workers.  
**Statistics:** 90% of people in Israel don’t know CPR; only 30% have basic first-aid training.

---

**System Architecture:**

- **Frontend:** Flutter (Dart)  
- **Storage:** JSON (protocols) + SQLite (user data, settings)  
- **Audio:** Native TTS for offline voice guidance  
- **Logic:** Deterministic state machine  

**Core Flow:**

1. User selects emergency category  
2. System loads JSON protocol  
3. Step[i] is displayed & TTS reads instruction  
4. User completes step → taps "Next"  
5. Repeat until procedure ends  
6. System logs incident in local history
