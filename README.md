# GurdianAngel
A mobile app that provides step-by-step, interactive instructions for common emergencies (burns, CPR, choking, bleeding, etc). The app uses text-to-speech technology for hands-free, voice-guided instructions—critical when users need both hands to help the victim.

## UI/UX Mockups (Alpha Stage)
The mockups are available in both English (en) and Hebrew (he) under docs/mockups/.
They represent design concepts only (no implementation).
